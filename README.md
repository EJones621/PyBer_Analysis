# Pyber Analysis

## Project Introduction
The PyBer Analysis reviews a ride-sharing app called, "PyBer". The analysis pulls data from January 2019 through April 2019. We want to see the relationship between a few different things including, area type (Rural, Suburban, Urban), driver count, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. 

## Results
After the data was read and imported into Jupyter Notebook and analyzed further, we found a few notey things worth mentioning. First, we'll take a look at this line chart:

As we can see, urban revenue is the highest, which makes sense. Urban city had the highest because they have more people and more drivers, but their rides tend to be shorter in duration. There is no clear indication as to why there are certain dips and increases from month-to-month. The only piece of information that may explain it would be the weather, but we unfortunately do not have that data. Urban city types have a far higher volume in total rides than both rural and suburban, but the average fare is smaller because of duration of the ride. Nonetheless, urban riders bring in nearly 63% of all revenue.


## Conclusion
Here are recommendations for all three city types:
##### Urban
1. As mentioned earlier, with urban riders bringing in nearly 63% of revenue to PyBer, it may be worthwhile to look further into cities that have a low fare cost and either dismiss them all together or increase the fare.

##### Suburban
2. Suburban areas are right in the middle among the city types, but between the other two (royal & urban) they bring in a positive correlation between the fare and number of riders. It may be worthwhile looking into the suburban areas to increase the total overall revenue.

##### Rural
3. Since rural city rides have the highest fare, increasing the number of rides would drive up revenue a lot more.
